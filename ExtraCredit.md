# Extra Credit - Question 3

## Question A

![Physics Question Image](physics_question_3.png)

There are two blocks connected together by a string pulled over a frictionless, massless pulley. There is friction between the blocks and the ramp. If **M=2m**, find an equation for the coefficient of static friction as a function of **&theta;<sub>1</sub>** or **&theta;<sub>1</sub>** and **&theta;<sub>2</sub>**. Assume the force of static friction is at a maximum.

Important: Let the following always be true: 

$$\theta_{1}+\theta_{2}=90^{o};$$


Useful trigonometric identities:

$$sin(\theta-90)= -cos(\theta)$$
$$sin(\theta+90)= cos(\theta)$$
$$cos(\theta-90)= sin(\theta)$$
$$cos(\theta+90)= -sin(\theta)$$

## Question B

I have made the claim in class that when dealing with an object on a ramp, the angle the ramp makes with the horizontal is equal to the angle the force vector for the force of gravity makes in the corresponding FBD. Prove this is true using algebra and geometry.
